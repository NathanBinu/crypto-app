# Project Plan for Crypto-App

## Components
- **Header**: Contains the title of the application and any navigation links.
- **CryptoList**: Displays a list of cryptocurrencies with their current prices.
- **CryptoItem**: A sub-component used by `CryptoList` to render individual cryptocurrency details.

- **Milestone 2**: Integrate the CoinGecko API for live data fetching.
- **Milestone 3**: Implement search functionality.
- **Milestone 4**: Add real-time updates and improve styling.
